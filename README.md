# DPFL
Differentially Private SGD for Decentralized Federated and Split Learning Models.

dp-decent contains relevant code for decentralized learning experiments.

dp-split contains relevant code split learning experiments. 

Base code pulled from https://github.com/bt-s/Split-Learning-and-Federated-Learning. 
Opacus is incorporated to introduce Gaussian noise into gradient updates. 

Your choice on dataset, but Fashion MNIST is expected.
